## Description
This assignment, is to architect and build a solution for managing a company's employees using node, inquirer, and MySQL.
* We use the [MySQL](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql) NPM package to connect to your MySQL database and perform queries.

* We use [InquirerJs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/0.2.3) NPM package to interact with the user via the command-line.

* We use [console.table](https://www.npmjs.com/package/console.table) to print MySQL rows to the console. There is a built-in version of `console.table`, but the NPM package formats the data a little better for our purposes.

* It is a **command-line** application that allows the user to:
  * View all employees 
  * View employees by department
  * View employees by Role
  * Update employee roles
  * Add roles
  * Add employees
  * Delete employees

* We have a database schema containing three tables:
  * **department**
  * **role**
  * **employee**

## Instructions
Start running the command-line **node server.js** Then answer the questions on:
 * **What would you like to do?**
